# My To-Do App ReadMe

Welcome to my To-Do app, a simple app thats made to help keep your day a bit more organized.

## Description

This app was made with people like myself in mind who get shinny lighted far to easily and need 
a visual reminder of what is supposed to be done. The app is easy to use and is targeted for, but 
not limited to, people who work at their computer.

## Usage

To use the To-Do app simply click `Add New Task` and fill out the form. Once submited it will be added
to the `Home` tab. There are two buttons attched to the tasks, a `âœ”` and a `X` button. The `âœ”` button
moves the task to the `Completed Tasks` tab to help track what you've done so far. The `X` button will
remove the task permanently. When a task is completed the `âœ”` is relaced with a `ðŸ”„` button that moves
the task back to the `Home` tab. The `X` still permanently deletes the task.
